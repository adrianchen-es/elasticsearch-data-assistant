# Consolidated Implementation Notes

This file summarizes the recent changes, test strategy, and areas to watch when running the codebase.

## Key Backend Changes
- Mapping normalization and error handling
  - `backend/utils/mapping_utils.py` now normalizes many shapes returned by Elasticsearch (strings, dicts, pydantic models, objects with `.body`). The helper `normalize_mapping_data` ensures downstream code sees a dictionary or an empty dict.
  - `extract_mapping_info`, `flatten_properties`, and `format_mapping_summary` produce a flattened, display-friendly mapping summary.

- AI service and tracing
  - `backend/services/ai_service.py` instruments AI prompts/responses with sanitized trace events when debug is enabled.
  - Sanitization ensures IP addresses and API-key-like tokens are not emitted in logs or spans.

- Elasticsearch tracing
  - `backend/services/elasticsearch_service.py` attaches a sanitized `db.statement` and `db.query` event to query spans.

- RaG / Regeneration guard
  - `/query/regenerate` endpoint now verifies the index schema contains usable text/keyword/dense_vector fields before performing expensive RaG generation.

## Frontend Changes (high level)
- Index / Tier selectors grouped indices into `frozen`, `cold`, `system`, and `other` categories based on naming conventions (`partial-`, `restored-`, `.` prefixes).
- Compact UI improvements: truncated index names, narrower selector width, and tooltips exposing full index names on hover.
- Mapping display: `CollapsibleList` component renders mapping fields and supports collapse/expand for long lists.
- Chat UI: added `includeContext` toggle and `Show Debug Info` wiring to display sanitized backend debug payloads.

## Tests & CI notes
- Tests live under `test/`. Some tests are async and require `pytest-asyncio` to run correctly.
- A new quick smoke test `test/test_consolidated_smoke.py` verifies core mapping utilities and import sanities without async dependencies.
- CI should install `pytest-asyncio` and start dependencies (Elasticsearch, OTEL collector) when running the full suite.

## Security & Observability
- Sensitive values (IP addresses, API keys) are masked before logging or being attached to spans.
- Tracing spans include sanitized AI inputs/responses and sanitized DB statements to aid debugging while avoiding leaks.

## Next recommended steps
1. Install `pytest-asyncio` in the test environment for full coverage: `pip install pytest-asyncio`.
2. Add a lightweight CI matrix that runs the smoke tests (fast) and the full test suite (with services) separately.
3. Add end-to-end tests that exercise streaming chat via the gateway to ensure streaming enforcement is compatible.
